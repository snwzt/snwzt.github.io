# Food I love
Everyone eats food because mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell, and my stomach is the self-destructive nuclear arsenal. I mean, why? Why on earth do I need hydrochloric acid to digest food? That sounds dangerous. Once I accidentally touched a dropper that someone left on my table, which was used for taking out concentrated HCl. I still remember the horror that I felt that day. Anyhoo, let's get started with the list:

## Beverages
1. Coffee
2. Fizzy fruit drinks (Appy used to be the sweet green of heaven. What the hell, Parle? Why did you make it worse? You make Appyâ€”can't you just reverse the DLC content you added to Appy?)
3. Ginger Ale
4. Iced Tea (the cold leaf juice)
5. Mushroom soup

## Fruits
1. Watermelon
2. Guava
3. Golden Delicious Apples
4. Waternut
5. Strawberries
6. Black Grapes
7. Kiwi
8. Pineapples (I want to love this fruit, but it is so hard to cut properly.)
9. Jackfruit (The taste is out of this world, but you need gorilla power to cut the darn thing, and I don't go to the gym because I'm poor.)

## Snacks
1. Ice cream (We all scream for ice cream.)
2. Muffins
3. Cheese-flavored / Jalapeno-flavored Nachos
4. Burger (Borgir)
5. Top Ramen Instant Noodles (Curry flavor)
6. Momos / Dumplings (I refuse to believe someone hates dumplings. How can you not love Kung Fu Panda?)
7. Pizza
8. Dark Chocolate
9. Yogurt / Raita
10. Pasta

## Proper Food
I have no idea. I like most Indian dishes. If I had to pick one, I'd pick my mom's Shahi Paneer, which has been tuned to my taste over the years. (Thank you, Ma.)
